What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is a Tool and Framework

BBD - Benefits of BBD

Collaboration
Focus on End User
Business Values

Why we use Cucumber Test Framework?
is to execute examples expressed in Gherkins

We should use the following key words when creating manual test cases
1) Given    - Pre condition
2) When     - To perform actions
3) And      - Supporting tag
4) Then     - Expected result/Outcome

To write Gherkin scenarios, we use feature files which is stored in the resources package
 within the features package

User Story - Test Case 12345 - Search Employee by name

Given the user is able to open Chrome Browser
When  user enters username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user is navigated to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee search option
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee list option
When user enters name in the employee name field
And user clicks on search button
Then user is able to see the employee

US - 12346 - Search employee by ID

Given the user is able to open Chrome Browser
When  user enters username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user is navigated to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee search option
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee list option
Then user is able to see the employee

-- Cucumber encourages code re-usability concept --

main area is used by Developers, so we don't want to make any changes
in there, so its fine to delete this area as Testers

test - this is where we should set up our POM (Page Object Model)

There's 2 things we have in every project

- code - java
- non-Java (adding excel/properties file)

coding will be at one place
non java will be at another place

POM (Page Object Model) -
Page object model is a design pattern in which we create object repository
