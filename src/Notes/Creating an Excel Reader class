The process of of creating a class that will read the excel file


1) The first thing you need to do is first get the location and open it

BELOW INSTANCE VARIABLE

    static Workbook book;
    static Sheet sheet;


WE USE FILEINPUTSTREAM TO READ THE FILE

   public static void openExcel(String filePath){
           //opening the excel file
           try {
               FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filePath);
               book = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);
           } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
               //to get exception if file is not available
               e.printStackTrace();
           } catch (IOException e) {
               //to get exception if input or output is not upto the mark
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }

2) Now we need to figure out what sheet we want to work with because there could be many sheets

The following is the way to pick the sheet

 public static void getSheet(String sheetName){
        // it will identify the sheet we are going to read from excel file
        sheet = book.getSheet(sheetName);
    }

3) Now we have the sheet we need to read the data in sheet, we do the following,

3a) get the physical number of rows
    public static int getRowCount(){
        //it will return total rows having the data
        return sheet.getPhysicalNumberOfRows();
    }

3b) Now we need to figure out how many columns each row has

    public static int getColsCount(int rowIndex){
        //it will return total number of columns from every row
        return sheet.getRow(rowIndex).getPhysicalNumberOfCells();
    }

3c) Now this is the last part that will help in reading the whole file

        public static String getCellData(int rowIndex, int colIndex){
            return sheet.getRow(rowIndex).getCell(colIndex).toString();
        }

4) This is the code that will integrate all the above code together and read the data

 public static List<Map<String, String>> excelListIntoMap
            (String filePath, String sheetName){

        openExcel(filePath);
        getSheet(sheetName);

        List<Map<String, String>> listData = new ArrayList<>();

        //outer loop
        //it takes care of total rows in excel file
        //it will read the values from all thr rows
        for (int row =1; row<getRowCount(); row++){

            //create a map every row
            Map<String, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
            //looping through all the values of the cell
            for (int col=0; col<getColsCount(row); col++){
                //it will add keys and values
                //0 index for row and col variable so that we get all the keys
                map.put(getCellData(0,col), getCellData(row, col));
            }
            listData.add(map);
        }


        return listData;
    }
