Data Tables vs Data Provider


Use Data Table if...
Instead of opening the website and logging in everytime to add multiple users to a system
you log in once and then add multiple people to the system.

DataTable only executes once whereas for Data provider it will execute multiple times


Example of Data Provider
 Scenario Outline:adding multiple employee from cucumber feature file
      When user enters "<firstName>", "<middleName>" and "<lastName>"
      And click on save Btn
      Then Employee is added "<firstName>", "<middleName>" and "<lastName>"

      Examples:
      |firstName    |middleName   |lastName |
      |empak        |can          |gulermi  |
      |canlar       |canim        |guler    |
      |kimin        |cani         |gulerdi  |
