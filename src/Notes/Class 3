--- Architecture of Framework ---

These are the following packages we create in our Framework

-Java
    - utils - to keep all the utilities of our project such as constants
        -in the following classes (CommonMethods,ConfigReader, Constants)
        -CommonMethod class extends PageInitialize

    - steps - all the step definition can be found here, they're the codes for the steps found in the feature
              file

    - pages - this is for POM (Page Object Model) all pages extends CommonMethods
            - PageInitializer class - this is used to initialize all the page classes
            - example below
             @FindBy(id = "btnLogin")
             public WebElement loginButton;

            - runners
                RunnerClass example below
                @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
                @CucumberOptions(
                        //features we use to provide the path of all the features file
                        features = "src/test/resources/features/SearchEmployee.feature",
                        glue = "steps"
                )
                public class RunnerClass {

                }




-resources (None-code)
    - config -
        -config.properties (class) - this is used to hold relevant information like url/username/password

    - features - this is the Gherkin steps of manual testing (Given, When, And, Then)
