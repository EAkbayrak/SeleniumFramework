Hooks vs Background

Hooks are applicable to all feature files
Background is applicable to just on feature file

Hooks execute first then background executes and in the end hooks
executes again as post condition

Hooks are for pre and post condition @after and @before

Within the runner class you can have the following,
**********************************************************************************************
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        //features we use to provide the path of all the features file
        features = "src/test/resources/features/",

        //You can use tags to groups tests together, you can have have multiple tags,
        tags = "@smoke", tags= "@Sprint23"


        glue = "steps",

        // set dryRun to true to quickly execute the code, and it will tell you if there's
        // any steps that need to be implemented


        dryRun = false,

        // keeping monochrome to true will clean you console output for cucumber
        // test if it has irrelevant or unreadable character in it
        monochrome = true

        plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber.html"}

        // "pretty" will create a report showing a log of every execution in the target folder, the target folder
        is automatically generated

        // "html" will create the report as a html file
